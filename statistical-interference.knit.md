# Exponential Distribution compare to Central limit Theorem
# The project consists of two parts:
# 1. A simulation exercise.
# 2. Basic inferential data analysis.
# 1: A simulation exercise
#  Overview
# In this project the exponential distribution is investigated in R and compare it with Central Limit Theorem. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also a function of 1/lambda. The exponential distribution is simulated in R with rexp(n,lambda), where lambda=0.2 for all of the simulations, sample size n = 40, and the number of simulation =1000.
# Simulations
# A series of 1000 simulations is run to create a data set for comparison purpose. Each simulation contain 40 observations and the expoential distribution function will be set to rexp(40, 0.2) where 0.2 is lambda value.
# Given data: n = 40; simNum = 1000; lambda = 0.2
# For reproducibility, set seed = 10000
# Exponential sampling parameters
# set seed for reproducability
set.seed(31)
# set lambda to 0.2
lambda <- 0.2
# 40 samples
n <- 40
# 1000 simulations
simulations <- 1000
# simulate
simulated_exponentials <- replicate(simulations, rexp(n, lambda))
# calculate mean of exponentials
means_exponentials <- apply(simulated_exponentials, 2, mean)

#Question 1

#Show where the distribution is centered at and compare it to the theoretical center of the distribution.

# The analytics mean is 5.006 the theoretical mean 5. The center of distribution of averages of 40 exponentials is very close to the theoretical center of the distribution.


# Question 2

# Show how variable it is and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution..

# standard deviation of distribution
standard_deviation_dist <- sd(means_exponentials)
standard_deviation_dist

# standard deviation from analytical expression
standard_deviation_theory <- (1/lambda)/sqrt(n)

# variance of distribution
variance_dist <- standard_deviation_dist^2
variance_dist
# variance from analytical expression
variance_theory <- ((1/lambda)*(1/sqrt(n)))^2
variance_theory

# Standard Deviation of the distribution is 0.7931608 with the theoretical SD calculated as 0.7905694. The Theoretical variance is calculated as ((1 / ??) * (1/???n))2 = 0.625. The actual variance of the distribution is 0.6291041
# Question 3
# Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
xfit <- seq(min(means_exponentials), max(means_exponentials), length=100)
yfit <- dnorm(xfit, mean=1/lambda, sd=(1/lambda/sqrt(n)))

# compare the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials to a normal distribution
qqnorm(means_exponentials)
qqline(means_exponentials, col = 2)
# Due to Due to the central limit theorem (CLT), the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials is very close to a normal distribution.

# Conclusion
# For dosage of .5 milligrams/day and 1 milligrams/day does matter the delivery method. the delivery method for 2 milligrams/day. For dosage of 2 milligrams/day the delivery method doesnâ€™t matter.
